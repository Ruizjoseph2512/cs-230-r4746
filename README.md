Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room was the client seeking to enhance their services by implementing an online booking system for their gaming lounge. They wanted a software application that would allow customers to easily reserve gaming stations and additional services online, such as food and beverages. The client desired a user-friendly platform to streamline the booking process and improve the overall customer experience at their gaming lounge.
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think i did a good job of clearly explaining what the client needed for their gaming lounge booking system. Made sure to cover all the important details like what features the software should have, how it should work, and what devices it should be compatible with. The evaluation section was especially detailed in looking at how the software would work on different devices, which was important for making sure everything ran smoothly. Overall, the documentation effectively communicated all the important information about the project in an easy-to-understand way.
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The design document was like a map that showed us how to build the code. It outlined the requirements, system design, and constraints, which helped us understand the structure of the system and how different parts would work together. Having a detailed model in the document helped us see the entities and relationships in the system, guiding how we wrote the code. The recommendations in the document also helped us make smart choices during coding. Basically, the design document was a guide that kept us on track and made sure our code matched what we planned.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
If I could change something in our work on these documents, I would focus on improving the user stories part. User stories help us understand what the users want and need. By making the user stories more detailed, we can create a design that better meets their expectations and makes them happy.
Considering the user's needs is important because it helps us make sure the software is easy to use and meets their requirements. Making the software user-friendly and tailored to their needs increases user satisfaction and adoption. Thinking about the user also helps us identify any potential problems with usability, making the software more efficient and effective. Overall, focusing on the user leads to a better software solution.
I design software by talking to users, making user profiles, and writing user stories to understand what they need. In the future, I will continue to do this and also test the software with real users, create visual designs, and get feedback to make improvements. I will also involve different team members and stay updated on design trends to keep the software user-friendly and up-to-date.
